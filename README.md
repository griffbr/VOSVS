## Code

Source code for our video object segmentation-based framework is located in the ``/robot_exp`` folder.

Source code for annotating data and training OSVOS for segmentation is located in the ``/OSVOS_train`` folder.

The VOSVS Benchmark uses a single consecutive set of mobile robot trials using a single RGB camera. Visual Servo (VS) is a success ( \\ ) if the robot moves within reach of an object for depth estimation (DE), which, in turn, is a success if the robotâ€™s gripper closes on an object without collision (X). Please see our paper for more details. YCB Dataset objects are available [here](https://www.ycbbenchmarks.com/). The bins we use for varying depth were originally purchased [here](https://www.amazon.com/IRIS-USA-Inc-Multi-Purpose-Plastic/dp/B07CQ9B8W3/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1547231250&sr=8-7&keywords=plastic+bins+for+toys).

__HSR Segmenting Objects at Various Heights.__ HSR's grasp camera faces downward (left) and only collects RGB data for objects in the scene (top right). However, using active perception and video object segmentation (bottom right), HSR can locate and grasp a variety of objects in real time.

__Depth Estimation of Sugar Box.__ Data are collected and processed in real time during the initial approach to the sugar box in the video demonstration.
